## SQL snippets

**SQL snippets** are reusable bits of SQL. Anyone with permissions to the [SQL editor](writing-sql.md) can create and edit snippets, and those snippets become available for all to take advantage of (provided they have permissions to the data, of course).

For example, if you frequently perform queries that involve multiple tables, you can save the SQL code that joins those tables as a snippet so that you (and others in your organization) can reuse that code in multiple questions.

### How to create a snippet

Here's a simple query with a simple join using the **Sample Dataset** included with Metabase.

```sql
select *
from ORDERS
left join PRODUCTS on PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT_ID;
```

Let's save the join statement as a snippet to reuse in other queries.

In the **SQL editor**:
 
1. **Highlight a section of SQL** that you want to snip. In this case, we'll snip:
```
from ORDERS 
left join PRODUCTS on PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT_ID
```

2. **Right-click on the highlighted section**.
3. **Select Save as snippet** to create a snippet. A modal will pop up with the SQL statement you highlighted. 
4. **Edit, name, and describe your snippet**, then click the save button.

In this case, we named the snippet "Orders and Products". The snippet will now be available for anyone to use. Here's what the snippet looks like in the SQL editor:

```sql
select * 
{{snippet: Orders and Products}};
```

When editing in the SQL editor, you can now start typing `{{snippet:` and Metabase will present autocomplete options for available snippets.

### Snippet menu

The SQL editor **sidebar** has a snippets menu to list available and archived snippets.

Click on the code icon on the right side of the SQL editor, below the **Data Reference** book icon (learn about your data) and the **Variables** Ï‡ icon. Metabase will slide out a sibebar menu that lists available snippets.

From the Snippet menu, you can:


- **Preview the snippet**. Click on the down arrow to the right of a snippet to see a preview of its SQL code. There's also an option to edit the snippet.

- **Insert the snippet at point**: Click on a snippet to insert it into your query at the current cursor point.

### Editing snippets

You can **edit** the snippet at any time by clicking on the down arrow to the right of the snippet in the snippet menu sidebar, and clicking on the **Edit** button. You can change the SQL code, snippet name, and snippet description.

Editing snippets are a great way to make changes to many questions at once. If, for example, you've saved the SQL code to pull user data from tables X, Y, and Z as the snippet `User Data`, but you need to change how that data is pulled (such as by adding data from another column or table), you can update the SQL code in the snippet, and all questions that use that snippet will have the updated code. 

> Caution: if you edit the snippet and include broken code, you will break every question that uses that snippet, so be sure to test your code before saving it to a snippet. With great power comes great responsibility.

### Archived snippets

You can also **archive** the snippet, which removes the snippet from the menu, but does not affect any existing queries that use the snippet.

**Archived snippets** are snippets that are no longer available in menus. Archiving snippets can help keep dated or less relevant snippets out of the way. When you archive a snippet, the snippet no longer populates in the snippet autocomplete dropdown, and the snippet will no longer show up in the list of of snippets in the **SQL editor** sidebar.

You can access an archived snippet from the snippet sidebar menu by clicking on the archived button in the bottom left of the sidebar.

You can archive and unarchive a snippet at any time.

**Archiving** does _not_ affect how **snippets** work in queries, so you can change the **archive** status of a snippet without breaking anyone's query.

### Enterprise Edition features

The Enterprise Edition of Metabase supports some additional organizational functionality for **snippets** to help admins organize and control access to **SQL snippets**.
